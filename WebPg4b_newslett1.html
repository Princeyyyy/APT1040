		all played over two legs. The six surviving teams enter the group stage,
		joining 26 teams qualified in advance.
		The 32 teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams and play each other in a double round-robin system.
		The eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.
		The winner of the Champions League qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.</th>
